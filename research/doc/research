determine rate of growth for population based on internet growth
get statistics for vandalization/fraud to determine rate of malicious additions/changes
get SAT of students to determine accuracy
administer SAT to teachers to determine accuracy
get number of publications divided by time to determine rate of information added
use web poll to determine rate of contribution
record IP of visitors to determine percent of users who contribute

webpoll shows percent of population for each question
q1. If you knew original information on a topic, would you add it on a wiki? (rate of growth = yes/contributing population)
q2. If you spotted false information, would you change/delete it? (rate of modification = yes/contributing population)

change = addition + deletion
rate of contribution = contributing population / total population

1. determine if passive or active user
2. if active, determine if user modifies and/or adds information
3. determine if user is good or malicious
4. if modifies, randomly select a token
5. determine if user accurately identifies what type of token
5.a. malicious user will not check, just automatically delete
6. if user identified token as maletoken, delete token
7. if user adds, determine if new information is correct or not and add token occurdingly
7.a. malicious user will automatically add a maletoken

1. rate of contribution
2. rate of growth, rate of modification
3. rate of vandalism/fraud
4. random number generator
5. population accuracy
6. N/A
7. population accuracy
